# Field Target Click Chart Generator
This app is designed to generate a click chart for your sub 12ft/lb field target rifle.

The initial code came from [Yet Another External Ballistic Kalculator](https://ptosis.ch/ebalka/ebalka.html) by Alexandre Trofimov.

I have simplified the code to remove the majority of the features that were in place for firarms and modified it so it suits sub 12ft/lb air rifles instead.

The drag profiles have been taken from a few sources. I used the profile from the [ChairGun Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hawke.chairgun) app as my basis for GA, and also used a profile which I found on [Gateway to Airguns](https://www.gatewaytoairguns.org/GTA/index.php?topic=159961.msg155778237#msg155778237). There are two G1 profiles, one which was included in the code as standard and one from [ChairGun Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hawke.chairgun) app. There's also a GA profile which came from ChairGun Pro on macOS.

There are issues with the charts if the preset ranges are modified so for the time being these options are disabled, although it is my intention to implement them in the future should I feel there's a need.

Feel free to raise issues, PR's or fork this repo as you see fit.
